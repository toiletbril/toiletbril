i am a goofball with experience mainly in C/C++, Rust, Javascript and Haskell.

aside from programming, i am really keen on tea and chicory.

i really like talking to people, exploring low-level systems, collaborating on
stupid projects and especially creating something new! feel free to reach out to
meeee.
