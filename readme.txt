i am a goofball with experience mainly in C/C++, Rust, Javascript and Haskell.

aside from programming, i am really keen on acoustic music and extreme vocals,
photography and epistemology.

i really enjoy talking to people, exploring novel systems, collaborating on
stupid projects to understand the fundamentals. feel free to reach out to meeee!
